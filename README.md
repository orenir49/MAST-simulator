The relevant files/folders for simulating MAST images, SNR and spot sizes:
* simulate.ipynb (python notebook)
* kernels_rings (folder)
* ccd_data (folder)
* RMSvsField_text.txt

The rest are auxiliary files we used to write and test different aspects of the code. 

Make sure relevant files/folders are uploaded to your workspace, and open 'simulate.ipynb'.
Click 'run all' and scroll all the way down. You'll see two buttons ('simulate image') and ('plot snr vs field').
Both programs depend on your inputs (all interactive in the notebook- you'll see where to plug everything in).
You may need to wait around ~30 seconds for the image to appear.
